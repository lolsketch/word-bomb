Welcome to the party, pal!

This template provides a minimal setup to get PartyKit & React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This is a [Partykit](https://partykit.io) project, which lets you create real-time collaborative applications with minimal coding effort.

[`server.ts`](./src/server.ts) is the server-side code, which is responsible for handling WebSocket events and HTTP requests.

You can start developing by running `npm run dev`. When you're ready, you can deploy your application on to the PartyKit cloud with `npm run deploy`.
